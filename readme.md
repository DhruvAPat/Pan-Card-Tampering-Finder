# Pan Card Tampering Finder

The Pan Card Tampering Finder is a project aimed at detecting tampering or alterations in PAN (Permanent Account Number) cards using computer vision techniques. This repository contains the code and resources necessary to implement the tampering detection system.

## Background

PAN cards are crucial identification documents used in financial transactions and official procedures in India. Unfortunately, instances of tampering, forgery, or alterations in PAN cards have become increasingly common, leading to fraudulent activities. The Pan Card Tampering Finder project aims to address this issue by leveraging image processing and machine learning techniques to detect potential tampering in PAN cards.

## Functionality

The Pan Card Tampering Finder performs the following key functions:

1. Image Preprocessing: The system processes the input PAN card image to enhance image quality, remove noise, and normalize lighting conditions, preparing it for further analysis.

2. Region of Interest (ROI) Extraction: The system identifies and extracts relevant regions of the PAN card, such as the photograph, signature, and other important fields.

3. Tampering Detection: Using computer vision algorithms and machine learning models, the system analyzes the extracted regions of the PAN card to detect potential tampering or alterations. It compares the extracted features with the expected characteristics of genuine PAN cards.

4. Tampering Localization: If tampering is detected, the system localizes the areas on the PAN card that have been tampered with, highlighting them or providing a detailed report.

## Usage

To use the Pan Card Tampering Finder, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Prepare the input PAN card image for analysis by scanning or capturing a high-resolution photograph.

3. Run the system's main script, providing the path to the PAN card image as input.

4. The system will process the image, extract relevant regions, and perform tampering detection analysis.

5. If tampering is detected, the system will indicate the presence of tampered regions, providing visual cues or a comprehensive report outlining the detected alterations.

## Dataset

The effectiveness of the Pan Card Tampering Finder relies on a carefully curated dataset of genuine and tampered PAN card images. This dataset is not provided in this repository due to privacy concerns and licensing restrictions. However, instructions on how to create or obtain such a dataset, along with annotations or labels for training, can be found in the accompanying documentation.



## Disclaimer

The Pan Card Tampering Finder is an ongoing project and may not provide 100% accuracy in detecting tampering or alterations in PAN cards. It is essential to consider other verification measures and consult official authorities for a comprehensive assessment of PAN card validity. This project is meant to assist and raise awareness regarding PAN card tampering, but it should not be solely relied upon for making legal or financial decisions.
